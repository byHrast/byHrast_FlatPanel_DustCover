UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

In the future I have a plan to make a YouTube assembly tutorial. 

Digital Servo Motor 270° MG996R x 1 (you will receive a bag of accessories for what you need for this project) 
Screw M5x50 x 1
Screw M5x20 x 1
M5 nut x 1
Washers for the M5 screw x 3
Heating Wire 0.25mm 500mm (only if you like to add antifrost/dew functionality) 
Bearing 5x10x5 x 1
Led strip 0.5m cold white
Ceiling light LED where the diffuser diameter is fi130 * 

*Basically, you will buy a ceiling LED light only to retrieve a diffuser. LED strip inside will not fit your needs. because ACDC is probably way different than 12V.
